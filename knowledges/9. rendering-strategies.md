# Rendering Strategies: CSR vs SSR vs SSG

## Overview

This document provides a centralized overview of the three main rendering strategies in modern web development: Client-Side Rendering (CSR), Server-Side Rendering (SSR), and Static Site Generation (SSG).

## Rendering Process Flow

### CSR (Client-Side Rendering)

```
Server → HTML + JS Bundle → Browser Downloads JS → React Executes → Full Interactivity
```

- **Initial page**: Blank/loading state
- **JavaScript does all the rendering**
- **Performance**: Slower initial load, faster subsequent navigation
- **Process**: Server sending HTML and JS files → Browser downloads JS → Browser executes React → Page full dynamic (loaded)

### SSR (Server-Side Rendering)

```
Server Renders HTML → Static HTML Displayed → JS Downloads in Background → Hydration → Full Interactivity
```

- **Initial page**: Fully rendered content
- **Server pre-renders on each request**
- **Performance**: Fast initial load, SEO-friendly
- **Process**: Server built out HTML page and sends to the browser → Static HTML is rendered and Browser downloads JS in background (loaded) → Loaded React adds interactivity to the page → Page full dynamic

### SSG (Static Site Generation)

```
Build Time HTML Generation → Static HTML Served → JS Downloads in Background → Hydration → Full Interactivity
```

- **Initial page**: Pre-built static content
- **HTML generated at build time**
- **Performance**: Fastest initial load, excellent SEO
- **Process**: HTML files are generated on build time → Static HTML is rendered and Browser downloads JS in background → Loaded React adds interactivity to the page → Page full dynamic

## Key Decision Matrix

| Factor                        | CSR       | SSR       | SSG        |
| ----------------------------- | --------- | --------- | ---------- |
| **Initial Load Speed**        | Slow      | Fast      | Fastest    |
| **SEO Performance**           | Poor      | Excellent | Excellent  |
| **Server Complexity**         | Low       | High      | Medium     |
| **Content Freshness**         | Real-time | Real-time | Build-time |
| **Hosting Cost**              | Low       | High      | Low        |
| **Time to First Byte (TTFB)** | Fast      | Medium    | Fastest    |
| **Time to Interactive (TTI)** | Slow      | Medium    | Fast       |

## Core Web Vitals Comparison

### Performance Metrics Overview

| Metric                             | CSR                 | SSR                  | SSG                | Description                          |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**   | ❌ Slow (2-4s)      | ✅ Fast (0.5-1.5s)   | ⭐ Fastest (<0.5s) | Time until first content appears     |
| **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)** | ❌ Poor (3-6s)      | ✅ Good (1-2.5s)     | ⭐ Excellent (<1s) | Time until main content loads        |
| **Time to Interactive (TTI)**      | ❌ Slow (3-8s)      | ⚠️ Medium (2-4s)     | ✅ Fast (1-3s)     | Time until page is fully interactive |
| **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**  | ⚠️ Variable         | ✅ Low               | ⭐ Minimal         | Visual stability during loading      |
| **First Input Delay (FID)**        | ❌ High (100-300ms) | ⚠️ Medium (50-100ms) | ✅ Low (<50ms)     | Responsiveness to user input         |

### Subsequent Navigation Performance

| Navigation Type             | CSR                   | SSR                        | SSG                        | Notes                                   |
| --------------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Page-to-Page Navigation** | ⭐ Instant (50-200ms) | ⚠️ Medium (500-1500ms)     | ⚠️ Medium (300-800ms)      | CSR excels with client-side routing     |
| **Data Fetching**           | ✅ Fast (100-500ms)   | ❌ Slow (full page reload) | ❌ Slow (full page reload) | CSR can fetch data without page refresh |
| **User Experience**         | ⭐ Smooth transitions | ⚠️ Page flickers           | ⚠️ Page flickers           | CSR provides app-like experience        |
| **Browser Back/Forward**    | ✅ Instant            | ❌ Full reload             | ❌ Full reload             | CSR maintains state and position        |

**Key Insight**: CSR's weakness in initial load becomes its strength in subsequent navigation, providing near-instant page transitions once the application is loaded.
