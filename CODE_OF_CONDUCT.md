- **Real-world Applications**: Connect algorithms to practical use cases when relevant

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject:
- Comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
- Content that is not aligned with this Code of Conduct
- Algorithm implementations that don't meet quality standards
- Discussions that become unproductive or harmful

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including:
- GitHub repository (issues, pull requests, discussions)
- Code reviews and comments
- Documentation and wiki contributions
- Community events or presentations
- Social media when representing the project
- Any other forums where community members represent the project

## Reporting Guidelines

### How to Report
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at:

**Email**: [your-email@example.com]
**GitHub Issues**: Use the "Report Conduct Issue" template
**Direct Message**: Contact maintainers directly through GitHub

### What to Include
When reporting, please include:
- Description of the incident
- Links to relevant conversations or content
- Screenshots if applicable
- Any additional context that would be helpful

### Response Time
All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident. We aim to respond to all reports within 48 hours.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction
**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning
**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban
**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban
**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.
