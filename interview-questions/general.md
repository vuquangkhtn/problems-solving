## General

### How does the browser render a website?

<!-- id: 5Bv7_9IB[3, noteType: Basic-66869 -->

Phase 1: Network operations

1. DNS lookup
2. TCP Connection
3. TLS Handshake
4. HTTP Request/Reponse

Phase 2: Browser rendering

1. HTML Parsing to DOM Tree: parse the HTML code in the document and create a DOM Tree while preload scanner find the CSS and JS files to download in parallel.
2. CSS Parsing to CSSOM Tree: block the rendering of the document.
3. Javascript Execution: parse and execute the javascript code in the document. block HTML parsing.
4. Render Tree Construction: combine the DOM Tree and CSSOM Tree to form the Render Tree.
5. Layout: calculate the position and size of each element in the document.
6. Painting: draw the pixels on the screen.
7. Compositing: combine the layers to form the final image. Leverage GPU acceleration.

Critical Rendering Path: is the sequence of steps the browser takes to render a website as mentioned above.

### Semantic Versioning

<!-- id: eY:H2@%.4, noteType: Basic-66869 -->

Semantic versioning means versioning your software in a way that the version numbers have significant meaning.
Node.js developers follow a three-digit versioning scheme: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.

### Optimistic UI Design

<!-- id: hN8B`-(Jk+, noteType: Basic-66869 -->

Updates the UI based on predictable states immediately, without waiting for the data response.
The response time should be less than 2 seconds.

### Atomic design methodology

<!-- id: N^VAY=#;8?, noteType: Basic-66869 -->

Atomic design is a methodology composed of five distinct stages working together to create interface design systems in a more deliberate and hierarchical manner.

The five stages of atomic design are:

- Atoms: elemental UI building blocks.
- Molecules: collections of atoms forming simple UI components.
- Organisms: complex UI components composed of groups of molecules and/or atoms and/or other organisms.
- Templates: place components into a layout and demonstrate the design’s underlying content structure.
- Pages: apply real content to templates to demonstrate the final UI and test.

### What are Micro Frontends? Pros and cons

<!-- id: xl$L(ll3{<, noteType: Basic-66869 -->

Micro frontends are a pattern where web application UIs are composed from semi-independent fragments.
Fragments can be built by different teams using different technologies.

Advantages:

- Team scalability.
- Strategic vs tactical focus.
- Reusability.
- Multiple frameworks.

Disadvantages:

- Complexity (communication, development, deployment).
- No standards.
- Increased payloads.

### SQL vs noSQL database

<!-- id: BajKzoY8*c, noteType: Basic-66869 -->

SQL is the programming language used to interface with relational databases. NoSQL is a class of DBMs that are non-relational and generally do not use SQL.

### Consistency, Availability and Partition Tolerance Trade offs

<!-- id: kUN[}Z<I0M, noteType: Basic-66869 -->

Tradeoff between consistency, availability, and latency exists even when there are no network partitions.
Reason for the tradeoff is that a high availability requirement implies that the system must replicate data.

### Monolith Repo?

<!-- id: IrHPS@zxIm, noteType: Basic-66869 -->

An app architecture for managing multiple packages from your local file system within a singular top-level, root package.
Dependencies can be linked together, which is a better mechanism than `yarn link`.
All your project dependencies are installed together.

### How do you handle state management in single-page applications?

<!-- id: x33bnAGIDa, noteType: Basic-66869 -->

Without a full framework or library like React or Vue.js, properly handling state management is not a trivial task.

Some options available through the language itself are:

- Global variables: Centralize state in global variables or a global object. This can become unmanageable for large applications and makes local state harder to maintain.
- Module pattern: Encapsulate state and provide a clear API to manage it. Instantiate local instances for individual components.
- Pub/Sub pattern: Decouple state changes using event-driven architecture. More complex, but flexible.
- State management libraries: Use Redux or similar libraries even without frameworks.

### Popular State Managements

<!-- id: t@x*lA5n0K, noteType: Basic-66869 -->

- Redux: predictable state container.
- Zustand: state management using simplified Flux principles; store is a hook usable anywhere, no provider needed.
- RxJS: library for reactive programming using Observables.
- React Query: data-fetching library for React; handles fetching, caching, synchronizing, and updating server state.

### How to write effective unit test

<!-- id: lyg>gf8Nk-, noteType: Basic-66869 -->

- Test small pieces of code in isolation.
- Follow Arrange–Act–Assert.
- Keep tests short and simple.
- Cover happy path first, then test edge cases.
- Write tests before fixing bugs.
- Make them performant.
- Keep them stateless and consistent.
- Use descriptive names.

### What is Bundler? Webpack vs Rollup vs Parcel

<!-- id: ifN|rI<[%Q, noteType: Basic-66869 -->

### CommonJS vs RequireJS (AMD) vs ES6 module

<!-- id: C0,[2LZ@7Q, noteType: Basic-66869 -->

- CommonJS: synchronous module loading; browsers cannot use directly without transpiling.
- AMD (RequireJS): asynchronous module loading; usable in browsers.
- ES6 modules: native JS modules; both sync and async loading; older browsers need a transpiler like Babel.

### Webpack properties: entry, output, resolve, module, plugins

<!-- id: o?*gFk]U-l, noteType: Basic-66869 -->

`npx webpack` takes an entry script as entry point and generates output as configured.

- resolve: configure how modules are resolved.
  - alias: use aliases instead of relative import paths.
  - extensions: resolve extensions in order; use `'...'` to include defaults.
- module: determine how different types of modules are treated.
  - rules: apply loaders or modify the parser when creating modules.
- plugins: array of webpack plugins; allow different behavior between development and release builds.

### Babel webpack plugins: @babel/core, @babel/plugin-transform-runtime, @babel/preset-env, @babel/preset-react

### What is tree shaking, and how does it help with the performance of a web application?

<!-- id: |0!0CpBzT_, noteType: Basic-66869 -->

Tree shaking is a technique used in JavaScript module bundlers, like Webpack or Vite, to remove unused code from the final bundled output.

Main benefits include:

- Reduced bundle size: removes unused code, improves load times and reduces bandwidth usage.
- Improved performance: smaller bundles parse and execute faster, improving responsiveness.
- Better resource utilization: write modular code without unused dependencies bloating the final bundle.

### Functional Programming

<!-- id: pI8_%h25(#, noteType: Basic-66869 -->

Functional programming builds software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side effects.
It is declarative rather than imperative, and application state flows through pure functions.

### OOP (Object-oriented programming)

<!-- id: L<`X3^^)Qq, noteType: Basic-66869 -->

### Refactoring/Code Review

<!-- id: nHvEZ*!+FP, noteType: Basic-66869 -->

- Move code to where it most logically belongs.
- Remove duplicate code.
- Make names self-documenting.
- Split methods into smaller pieces.
- Re-arrange inheritance hierarchies.
  Reference: Refactoring: clean your code.

### Code Review checklist

<!-- id: HTyE=OQv5s, noteType: Basic-66869 -->

Should:

- Identify obvious bugs.
- Look for possible security issues.
- Look for “clever” code that reduces readability or maintainability.
- Check for code duplication.
- Check for adherence to the team’s standardized process.
- Check whether names are descriptive enough.
- Look for possible performance improvements (expensive operations inside loops, excessive object allocations, inefficient string concatenations, inefficient logging).
- Check the presence and quality of tests:
  - Presence: Did the author create tests for their change?
  - Quality: Do the tests effectively exercise the system under test and follow best practices?
  - Readability: Tests are documentation; they should be simple and easy to understand.
  - Naming: Are tests named according to the team’s convention and easy to understand?
- Explain your changes.
- Optional: add code documentation.

Should not:

- Focus on cosmetic concerns.
- Rely on manual testing alone.
- Mismatch standardized processes between different team members.

### Test Driven Development (TDD) Cycle

<!-- id: dL.QS0ur6j, noteType: Basic-66869 -->

1. Add a test.
2. Run all tests; the new test should fail for expected reasons.
3. Write the simplest code that passes the new test.
4. Run all tests; they should now pass.
5. Refactor as needed, using tests after each refactor to ensure functionality is preserved.
6. Repeat from step 1.

Development cycle:

- Write tests first.
- Each test case fails initially.

### What is API gateway?

<!-- id: IL>ndQ?-Zf, noteType: Basic-66869 -->

An API gateway is an API management tool that sits between a client and a collection of backend services.
It acts as a reverse proxy to accept all API calls, aggregate the various services required to fulfill them, and return the appropriate result.
When a client makes a request, the API gateway breaks it into multiple requests, routes them to the right places, produces a response, and keeps track of everything.
Reference: What does an API gateway do? (redhat.com).
